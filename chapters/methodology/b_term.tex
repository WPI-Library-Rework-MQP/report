Our second term on this project led to the finalizing of planning and designs to then lead to the start of development. In order to best finalize our storyboards and designs, we met with the library staff on November 10th, 2022 for a second time during this project to get their feedback on the designs we had come up with. At this point, their feedback was minimal, thus we had little refining to do. They did propose great, yet minor, changes that we had not quite thought of.

At this point, we had a solid foundation that would guide our development process. The UI elements were implemented initially along with color, logo, and font schemes provided by WPI's Marketing and Communications department.
