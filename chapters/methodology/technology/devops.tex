    Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automating the process of integrating code changes into software.
    Since there were only two developers part of the MQP and we are not running a multi-billion-dollar company, we did not need to establish a complex CI.
    We chose to simply use GitHub Actions.
    Development commits (to non-\texttt{main} branches) compile and deploye to a staging URL.
    Production commits (to the \texttt{main} branch) compile and deploye to the main URL.
