TODO: Talk about web application.

\SubSubSection{Languages}{methodology}{technology}{frontend}{languages}

    For frontend development, we chose to use web technologies.
    This means that our application bundle will use web languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
    To provide a better development experience and to catch more bugs in compile time, we will use TypeScript over JavaScript whenever possible.
    TypeScript, unlike JavaScript, is strongly and statically typed.
    Statically typed languages are used throughout the Computer Science program at WPI.
    It is best that we apply these programming teachings in our MQP.
    We will also use Sass over CSS whenever possible.
    Sass is a CSS preprocessor that compiles into plain CSS.
    Sass makes it possible to write reusable functions and mixins for styles.

\SubSubSection{Frameworks}{methodology}{technology}{frontend}{frameworks}

    We chose to use Angular to build our web application.
    Specifically, Angular version 14, the latest major version as of this writing.
    Angular is a component-based framework for building web applications.
    The Angular family offers almost everything that we needed to build a scalable chat platform.
    We designed and implemented custom components with the look-and-feel according to \hyperref[ch:methodology:sec:conceptual_designs:subsec:wpi_guidelines]{WPI guidelines}.
