We worked closely with WPI's Information Technology department to create a Linux server for the MQP.
The server runs on Ubuntu Server 22.04.

    We used Apache HTTP Server to serve our web application.
    This decision was made to stay consistent with the web server used by other groups at WPI.

    PostgreSQL was our choice of database.
    While WPI's Computer Science courses utilize Oracle or SQL Server, we chose PostgreSQL because of our familiarity with it and its capabilities.
