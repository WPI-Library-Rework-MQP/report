Our first term of this project was dedicated to identifying the requirements of the system we planned to implement, what its designs would look like, appropriate use cases, and our goals for the remainder of the project. During this term, we met with the library staff initially on September 14th, 2022 to draw a baseline as to what their opinions were on the LibraryH3lp application they were using originally. Additionally, what they would like to see changed in a new version. After this, we were able to efficiently come up with storyboards that would best reflect what we had thought our application to look and feel like on an abstract level.
